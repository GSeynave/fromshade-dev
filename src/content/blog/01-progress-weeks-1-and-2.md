## Project idea: "Elevate"

*Description of the project in the big lines*

## The data

**Week 1 (Jan 5-11):**
- DSA : 3.5h
- SaaS : 10h

**Week 2 (Jan 12-18):**
- DSA : 4h
- SaaS : 12h
- Code setup: 2h
**Total time spent on project in 2 weeks: 31.5h**


## Key Takeaways

- Deleting AI code generated code in order to rewrite it myself. At first I wanted to see result, but that's not what I'm chasing.
The goal is to LEARN. Production will come later.
- Setting the environment right is key. Everything is under a few keystrokes, preventing to give up at any occasions.
- Tracking time spent coding is motivating. Seeing the hours pile up is rewarding.
- The power of habit. After a few days, it became natural to wake up early and code.
- Thinking long term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency over intensity.
  - Test using hurl.
  - Understanding the problem before jumping into code.
  - Focus on one thing at a time.


## Next Goals

*DSA*:
- Finish encode and decode string
- Start the next problem
 
*SaaS*:
- Finish kotlin migration and have a working (runnable) server.
- Clarify endpoint's needed for frontend.
- Fully clean the code base *Here the important thing is to understand every single line of code purpose ! (not algorithm wise but technically wise)*
- unit test + hurl test
