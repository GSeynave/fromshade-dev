## The Comfort Trap

You know this feeling, doing feature after feature, it almost become an automatism, nothing feels challenging.
That's it! We've become very skill, right ?

*It's time to find a job where i can fully expand my skills.*

That's what I thought to myself, before looking at the current market. <br>

That's when i realized, while the tech world was accelerating, what is my skills ? 
**I've only been plateauing.**

Five years into backend development, enough to be genuinely competent at execution. I could integrate systems, implement features, deliver on schedule. I'd found my rhythm. But rhythm isn't growth. I realized I'd been optimizing for what I already knew rather than stretching into what I didn't: system design, architectural trade-offs, technical leadership. In a world where AI handles routine implementation, those deeper engineering skills are what create lasting value

You know the rythm, start the day, take a task, implement the pattern you've used a dozen of times before. Test. Review. Ship.
Easy money, why complicate it ?

Experince keep pilling up, and this is what matter the most on resume most of the time, so after few year we can begin to slowly claim to be senior right ?
Decided to take a step forward, why not look at the current market to find a job that will allow me to work full remote.

And there it hit me, I am not a Software Engineer, I'm just an executor. I apply a task in a given context.
I lack the skills to design, to innovate, to lead.
And in our AI driven world, those skills are more important than ever if I want to stay relevant.

## What to except here

-- Rephrase here, negative input.
As you might have understand, I'm not the big brain guy. 
I will not pretend to give you tutorial, and how to become the next FAANG engineer.
I don't even want this myself. Instead i'll share you my journey, something real that everyone can accomplish too.
I have a full time job, a familly, so free time is limited. Don't except 40 hours a week of work.

Here's what you can expect from this blog:
- Real architectural decisions with actual trade-offs on my side projects
- Failed experiments 
- The messy process of learning while building production code
- Solutions that work for someone with limited time per day

## The Plan

To become a Software Engineer I need to upskill, and to not lose myself in this journey, I need a plan.
So here it is, my plan to become a Software Engineer:
- Grinding DSA problems to sharpen problem-solving skills. 
- Building side project.
- Discovering new languages and frameworks to broaden my horizons - Switch to Kotlin and add Vue frontend.
- Documenting my journey to stay accountable and help others in the same situation - Track my progress, provide insights and lessons learned.

The plan is simple, the execution will be the hard part.

Doing all of this is quite challenging as I have a full time job and a family.


## The 6:30 am Club

This sounds like a cliché, but waking up early is a game changer.
No distractions, just pure focus time with a fresh mind.
Wake up at 6:00 am, a meditation session, then straight to coding.
This routine allows me to add more than 10 hours of coding per week.


## Time tracking

To stay motivated, I track my time spent coding.
Seeing the hours pile up is rewarding.
It reminds me that every small step counts towards my goal.


## Why public blog?

As I mentioned earlier time is precious, so why add more work by writing a public blog?
I believe that sharing my journey will help me stay accountable.
It will also help others who might be in the same situation as me, and help them.

## The name "From Shade"

You're always in someone's shadow, whether it's a mentor, a colleague, a client, a senior. 
You execute, you deliver you disappear into the next contract.

From Shade is about stepping out of that shadow, into the light. Building my own path, my own identity as a Software Engineer.
Publicly failing, learning, and growing instead of hiding in the comfort of the routine.

This blog is the first step ou of my comfort zone. I'm getting out of the dark.
