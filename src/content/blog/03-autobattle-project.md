## The project

An Auto-Battle game.
This is, i think, well adapt for a web browser game as player might simply open tab do some action for optimization of then switch tab.
A browser game are not the target of ative gameplay.

To make it simple, my goal is to build an auto battle game where player need to compose its team.
Kill monster in free roaming area, craft equipment, go for dungeon to find the rarest resource and craft even better equipment.

This sound simple, but in my first week of work i've already encounter few difficulties.

I'll use this posts to share them with you, explain them so everyone can understand and find answer for their own project maybe.

## Technical stack

To be detailed.
