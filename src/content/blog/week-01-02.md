## The problem

FUll time job,
In a comfort zone 
Family time

Not evoluting with the market
Not enough time to learn new skills

## The solution

Wake up at 6:00 am

Yes this is early, but not that early.
I go to bed at 10:00 pm latest, so I get 8 hours of sleep.
.. Wake up, meditate, then straight to coding.
No distractions, no emails, no calls, just pure focus time.


## The data

**Week 1 (Jan 5-11):**
- DSA : 3.5h
- SaaS : 10h

**Week 2 (Jan 12-18):**
- DSA : 4h
- SaaS : 12h
- Code setup: 2h
**Total time spent coding in 2 weeks: 31.5h**


## Key Takeaways

- Deleting AI code generated code in order to rewrite it myself. At first i wanted to see reuslt, but that's not what i'm chasing.
The goal is to LEARN. Production will come later.
- Setting the environment right is key. Everything is under a few keystrokes, preventing to give up at any occasions.
- Tracking time spent coding is motivating. Seeing the hours pile up is rewarding.
- The power of habit. After a few days, it became natural to wake up early and code.
- Thinking long term. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Consistency over intensity.
  - Test using hurl.
  - Understanding the problem before jumping into code.
  - Focus on one thing at a time.
