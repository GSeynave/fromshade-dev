## My Story

- My goals of freedom, learning, and growth.
- Decided to really take control of my career in this end of 2025.
- The expansion of AI and its impact on the tech industry.
- The initial struggles of balancing a full time job, family, and learning new skills.
- Looked at the market, felt disconnected from the latest trends.
- Realized I needed to upskill
- Started a "SaaS" project aside from my full time job to learn new skills.
- Felt the need to document my journey, at first to assert that i understood what I was learning.
- Then felt like sharing it with others who might be in the same situation as me.
- Thus started this blog. 
- My journey is the not the most brillant one, but it's real, and I hope it can inspire others to take control of their careers too.
- Here came the name idea "From shade", a normal, everyday person, stepping out of the shade to take control of his career.
